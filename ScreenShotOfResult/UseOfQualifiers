Here we created 3 new classes 
1. BaseBallCoach.java
2. TennisCoach.java
3. TrackCoach.java

Now while doing the dependency injection for constructor and setter 
1. constructor
@Autowired
    public FunRestControoler(Coach theCoach)
    {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }
 2. setter
 @Autowired
    public void setCoach(Coach theCoach)
    {
        myCoach = theCoach;
    }

Now we have 4 implementation of Coach (BaseBallCoach,TennisCoach,TrackCoach, CricketCoach)
Springboot is not able to understand which on to inject, so it throws an error

Parameter 0 of method setCoach in com.jayantsharma.learning.jayantLearning.Rest.DemoSetterController required a single bean, but 4 were found:
        - baseBallCoach: defined in file [C:\SpringBootLearning\target\classes\com\jayantsharma\learning\Util\BaseBallCoach.class]
        - cricketCoach: defined in file [C:\SpringBootLearning\target\classes\com\jayantsharma\learning\Util\CricketCoach.class]
        - tennisCoach: defined in file [C:\SpringBootLearning\target\classes\com\jayantsharma\learning\Util\TennisCoach.class]
        - trackCoach: defined in file [C:\SpringBootLearning\target\classes\com\jayantsharma\learning\Util\TrackCoach.class]

Now to resolve this we use Qualifier annotation so that springboot knows which class object needs to be injected.
